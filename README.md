# 🏁 Formula One Interactive Dashboard (2020–2024)

This project analyzes Formula One data from the 2020 to 2024 seasons using Python and Power BI.

## 📌 About the Project
As a lifelong F1 fan, I created this dashboard to explore:
- Team performance across seasons
- Driver consistency vs speed
- Circuit-based analysis
- Race-by-race cumulative performance

With the 2025 season underway, I finally decided to release this from my archive and share it with the community!

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Ergast Developer API
- Power BI (.pbix)
- Pandas, Requests, Matplotlib (for EDA)

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
- Total Wins by Team
- Fastest Lap Speed by Circuit
- Driver Win Rate & Finish Status Distribution
- Speed vs Consistency Scatter Chart

## 🔍 Data Modeling
- Central fact table around `RaceId`
- Linked tables: Drivers, Constructors, Races, Results, LapTimes
- DAX Measures for KPIs

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook to view the data pipeline
3. Use the .pbix file to explore the Power BI visuals
4. Update with future races by calling the Ergast API

## 📂 Files Included
- `FormulaOne.ipynb` — Python notebook for data extraction and cleaning
- `FormulaOne 2020-2024.pbix` — Power BI Dashboard
- `FormulaOne 2020-2024.pdf` — Dashboard Summary Report

## 🏎️ Motivation
The latest race and the ongoing 2025 season made me realize it was time to share this dashboard with the world.

## 📬 Feedback
Open to suggestions, improvements, or a chat about who’s winning the title this year 😉
